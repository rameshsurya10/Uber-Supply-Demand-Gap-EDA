# **Uber Supply-Demand Gap Analysis** ðŸš–ðŸ“Š  

## **Overview**  
This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on Uber ride data to identify supply-demand gaps. By analyzing ride requests, cancellations, and trip fulfillment rates, it helps in understanding peak demand times and areas where supply shortages occur.  

## **Tech Stack**  
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries Used:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Data Source:** Uber trip data  
- **Visualization Tools:** Matplotlib, Seaborn  

## **Objectives**  
âœ… **Identify Peak Demand Hours:** Analyze when ride requests are highest.  
âœ… **Detect Supply Shortages:** Find areas/times with high ride cancellations or unfulfilled requests.  
âœ… **Understand User Behavior:** Evaluate ride patterns based on time, location, and trip status.  
âœ… **Suggest Improvements:** Provide insights for better resource allocation and driver availability.  

## **Key Insights**  
- **Time-Based Analysis:** Demand spikes during rush hours and weekends.  
- **Location Trends:** Airports and business hubs have frequent shortages.  
- **Cancellation Factors:** High wait times lead to more ride cancellations.  

## **How to Use**  
1. Load the dataset into a Jupyter Notebook or Python script.  
2. Use Pandas to clean and preprocess the data.  
3. Perform visualizations with Matplotlib/Seaborn to derive insights.  
4. Interpret the results and suggest solutions for Uber to balance supply and demand.  

ðŸ“Œ *Future Scope:* Predictive modeling for demand forecasting and dynamic pricing analysis.
